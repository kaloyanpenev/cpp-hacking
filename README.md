## Project Configuration

The project name is defined in `project.json` and is used by CMake, Vite, and the web frontend.

To rename the project, edit `project.json`:
```json
{
    "name": "your_project_name",
    "display_name": "Your Project Name"
}
```

> **Note**: If you plan to publish the web package to npm, you'll need to manually update the `name` field in `web/package.json` and `web/package-lock.json`. The placeholder name is automatically replaced during CI builds but not locally.
